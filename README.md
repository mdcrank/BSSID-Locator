# BSSID-Locator
## Description
This is a BSSID Locater utilizing googles geolocation API. This was inspired by [Samy Kamkar](http://samy.pl/androidmap/) who initially found the exploit in 2011. This code is a basic implementation of googles api to show what it can currently do.

## Use
In order to use this, follow [these directions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/cloud-setup) to set up your google cloud account. Then replace the YOUR_API_KEY in the code with your own and test it.
